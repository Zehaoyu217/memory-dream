## Q1
Both notes build directly on feat-c25-payment-behaviour and feat-c25-txn-recency. churn-gbm-2025-v2 also uses feat-c25-util-v2, and churn-lr-base-2025 uses feat-c25-util-v1 and feat-c25-app-sessions.
Notes: churn-2025/churn-gbm-2025-v2.md, churn-2025/churn-lr-base-2025.md, churn-2025/feat-c25-payment-behaviour.md, churn-2025/feat-c25-txn-recency.md

## Q2
cb-uplift-v1 is still current and builds directly on feat-cb-spend-base, which was replaced by feat-cb-spend-band-v2. cb-elasticity-v1 also builds on feat-cb-spend-base, but it is superseded by cb-elasticity-v2, so it does not count.

## Q3
Four decision notes rest on feat-app-util-new: dec-app-cutoff-v3, dec-app-no-gbm, dec-app-rebuild-v4 and dec-app-cutoff-v4. All four reach it through the app-scorecard-v3 and app-gbm chain.

## Q4
The line ends at cr-lgbm-v3, which is in force. It is built on cr-lgbm-v2, ds-cr-intent-labels, exp-106 and fnd-cr-threshold.
Notes: call-center-routing/cr-lgbm-v3.md, call-center-routing/cr-lgbm-v2.md, call-center-routing/ds-cr-intent-labels.md, call-center-routing/exp-106.md, call-center-routing/fnd-cr-threshold.md

## Q5
Only one note from another project builds directly on churn-gbm-2025-v2: feat-ror-churn-score in retention-offers-roi. ror-uplift-v1 uses the score only through that feature note.
Notes: retention-offers-roi/feat-ror-churn-score.md

## Q6
app-gbm-v2 rests on two dataset notes: ds-app-applications-2024 and ds-app-reject-sample. The first sits behind several of the earlier models, and the second feeds exp-501 and the reject-inference chain.
Notes: application-scorecard/ds-app-applications-2024.md, application-scorecard/ds-app-reject-sample.md

## Q7
Both csb-lr-base and csb-xgb-v1 build directly on feat-csb-spend-raw and feat-csb-tenure-band.
Notes: churn-small-business/csb-lr-base.md, churn-small-business/csb-xgb-v1.md, churn-small-business/feat-csb-spend-raw.md, churn-small-business/feat-csb-tenure-band.md

## Q8
churn-lr-base-2025 is the only current model that builds directly on a replaced feature. It uses feat-c25-util-v1, which was replaced by feat-c25-util-v2.
Notes: churn-2025/churn-lr-base-2025.md, churn-2025/feat-c25-util-v1.md, churn-2025/feat-c25-util-v2.md

## Q9
Five decision notes rest on ds-bt-offer-log, directly or through other notes: dec-bt-drop-post-offer-features, dec-bt-cut-mailer-top30, dec-bt-margin-label, dec-pa-6m-default and dec-pa-no-12m-subprime.

## Q10
The line ends at dec-cb-threshold-2500, which is in force. It is built on dec-cb-adopt-banded-tiers, exp-206-breakeven-sim and find-cb-breakeven-lift.
Notes: cashback-redesign/dec-cb-threshold-2500.md, cashback-redesign/dec-cb-adopt-banded-tiers.md, cashback-redesign/exp-206-breakeven-sim.md, cashback-redesign/find-cb-breakeven-lift.md
